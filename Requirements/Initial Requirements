Game
This is the meaty part of the code, our primary logic, the game!
It needs an instance of

Board
Game
Notice how Board already contains instances of Cell.
This also needs to contain the following
--> Ability and logic to use the classes we make and conduct a game!
--> Know when the game is over

So the following functions will be required:

A constructor to initialise the game with a snake and a board.
A function to return the snake.
A function to set the value of snake.
A function to return the board.
A function to set the value of board
A function to set the game to be over.
A function to check if the game is over.
A function to set the direction of snake's motion.
A function to return the direction of snake's motion.
A function to update the game according to snake's movement.
A function to keep track of the forthcoming cell.
After this we will also define a main function to actually play the game.
